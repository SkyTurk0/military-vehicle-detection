# MV-RSD YOLO: Object Detection on Military Vehicles Dataset

A professional deep learning project for training and evaluating object detection models on the **MV-RSD (Military Vehicle Remote Sensing Dataset)** using **YOLOv8n** and **YOLO12m** architectures.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This repository contains all resources and results related to training YOLO models for object detection on satellite images of military vehicles. The goal is to detect and classify five classes of vehicles in low-resolution aerial images.

- Dataset: [MV-RSD Dataset](https://www.scidb.cn/en/detail?dataSetId=2731ac4153464495b4dfd3caa8a9b0a0) *(downloaded from SciDB)*
- Models trained:
  - `YOLOv8n` (lightweight baseline)
  - `YOLO12m` (mid-weight architecture for better performance)

## üìà Evaluation & Discussion

- **Results Interpretation**: Both models achieved strong detection scores, with **YOLOv8n** slightly outperforming **YOLO12m** in overall mAP50 despite having far fewer parameters. The larger model, while more capable in theory, did not generalize significantly better under current training constraints.

- **Limitations**:

  - Small vehicles like AFVs performed the worst across both models.
  - Image quality and resolution limited detection accuracy.
  - Overlapping objects and low variation in lighting/weather impacted generalization.

- **Takeaways**:

  - A well-tuned smaller model (YOLOv8n) may be more efficient for edge deployments.
  - Improvements in data quality, better augmentation, or using higher input resolutions could enhance results.
  - Future experiments could test focal loss or dataset rebalancing.
